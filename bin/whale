# 20061009
# 0.1.1

# Description: Sometimes when they go fishing, they get a whale and it sinks their boat.  

# History: 
# 1. I took #read_words_file from difflist.  
# 2. I took a bit of RandomMethod for #random_word.   

# Changes since 0.0: 
# 1. It now has a verbose mode which will output the username and password which has been randomly generating just prior to it being submitted.  
# 2. Rejigged the value generation stuff, since I was not outputting the value submitted, but generating a new one.  That's the problem with DSLs: one forgets what's a variable and what's a method.  

# Todo: 
# 1. Command line options library needed really, since fixed order options is a bit bler.
