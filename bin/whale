WHALE_VERSION = '0.4.4'

# Description: Sometimes when they go fishing, they get a whale and it sinks their boat.  

# History: 
# 1. I took #read_words_file from difflist.  
# 2. I took a bit of RandomMethod for #random_word.   

# Discussion: 
# 1. As yesterday's site is down I've selected my next victim.  It is a PayPal phishing site and they've got some Javascript which  checks that the username conforms to being an acceptable email address.  Then I noticed that the form is not dependent on Javascript and so it could be gotton around by simply ignoring Javascript as Whale does.  However, since one of the goals is to make the real user data indistinguishable from the fake, it seems as if it is a better idea to make the data input from Whale look like the most likely set of real user data.  

# Changes since 0.3: 
# 1. I've added the option to select a user agent.  
# 2. I've also added the option to be able to follow meta-refresh links.  Neat!  I can test it on that PayPal phishing site which necessitated, or at least had recommended, having email addresses, since it used a meta-refresh.  
# 3. I've removed the debugging stuff.  
# 4. There was an error if there was no meta refresh of course!  So now it doesn't attempt to access the match data array unless there's something in it.  
# 3
# 5. Somtimes a form won't have a name, so I need to just grab the first one or a subsequent one if need be...  
# 6. Added a hash to pass in options to Whale.initialize.  
# 4
# 7. Added in option parsing via Options and Whale.parse_options.  
# 8. Enabled the use of this in the self-run block.  

# Todo: 
# 1. Command line options library needed really, since fixed order options is a bit blerrr.
