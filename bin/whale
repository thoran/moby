# 0.2.2

# Description: Sometimes when they go fishing, they get a whale and it sinks their boat.  

# History: 
# 1. I took #read_words_file from difflist.  
# 2. I took a bit of RandomMethod for #random_word.   

# Changes since 0.1: 
# 1. Added the time of script start into the output.  
# 2. Moved the output to immediately after submission.  
# 3. Added the count of submissions next to output of each username:password pair.  
# 4. It now attempts to trap when a break occurs to output a summary.  
# 5. The total number of submissions is now output at the end verbose or not.  

# Todo: 
# 1. Command line options library needed really, since fixed order options is a bit blerrr.  
# 2. Trap breaking into the loop and output stuff like the end time, total time, and total count.  End time and total count done as of 0.2.2.  Now I just need to do a time difference and then calculate the number per second or minute or something like that might be nice!
